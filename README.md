# Oasis

This is a platform that is intended to give individuals in diverse minority communities access to information about various all-inclusive locations. Those who are signed up for this application cannot not only access safe spaces, but also generate safe spaces of their own to share with others on the platform, or alert others of said locationâ€™s non-inclusive environment. Regardless of signed-in status, app users will be able to view all user-generated locations on the Home screen.

## Features Include:

- Viewing various locations and their 'Open To All' status
- Ability to create a profile and maintain your created locations.

## How To Use:

- Open up Expo app
- Load the application onto your phone
- At the top of the screen you will see a `Sign In` and `Sign Up` buttons that allow you to maintain a profile.
- Upon Sign In, a `Logout` button will be rendered on the top of the screen along with a `Profile` button below the status bar.
- If you would like to create a location, navigate to your profile page and press the `Create a Location` button and fill out the form.
- In order to set a location as open to all or the alternative, toggle the `Open/Not Open` switch.
- Once your location is created you have the ability to update or delete your respective locations via your `profile` page.
- Navigating back to home will present you with the list of user-generated locations in addition to your newly created location at the bottom of the page. 
- Upon `LogOut` your location will remain on the homepage and your profile page for future updates if desired.
